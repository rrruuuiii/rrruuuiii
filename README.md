Hello! I'm Rui, a Computer Science major at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in May 2025.

I have a deep interest in interactive theorem proving and theoretical computer science, and I'm keen on expanding my knowledge of machine learning, especially its applications in computer graphics.

Currently, I'm seeking summer 2024 internship opportunities where I can leverage and enhance my skills.
